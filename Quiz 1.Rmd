```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```
```{r}
##creating new data
flights_data= select(flights, 
                     dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
flights_data
write.csv(flights_data, "flights_nyc.csv")
```

###Problem 1. Find all the flights that Arrived more than two hours late but didnâ€™t leave late.
```{r}
more_than_2hrs_late_but_not_late=filter(flights,arr_delay>=120, dep_delay <= 0 )
more_than_2hrs_late_but_not_late
```


####Problem 2. How many flights have a missing dep_time?
```{r}

missing_dep_time_count = sum(is.na(flights$dep_time))


missing_dep_time_count



```

##Problem 3. Find the carrier which a highest average departure delay?
```{r}

average_delay_by_carrier=flights%>%group_by(carrier)%>%summarize(AvgDepartureDelay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

carrier_with_highest_delay = average_delay_by_carrier%>%filter(AvgDepartureDelay== max(AvgDepartureDelay))

carrier_with_highest_delay

```
###Problem 4
##Find the carrier which a lowest average departure delay?
```{r}


average_delay_by_carrier= flights %>% group_by(carrier) %>% summarize(AvgDepartureDelay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

carrier_with_lowest_delay = average_delay_by_carrier %>% filter(AvgDepartureDelay == min(AvgDepartureDelay))

carrier_with_lowest_delay


```

###Problem 5
###Find the month with the highest average departure delay?

```{r}

average_delay_by_month = flights %>%group_by(month) %>% summarize(AvgDepartureDelay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

month_with_highest_delay = average_delay_by_month %>% filter(AvgDepartureDelay == max(AvgDepartureDelay))

month_with_highest_delay


```
