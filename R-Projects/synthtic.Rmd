# First we will load Synth and dplyr.
# If you haven't already installed Synth, now would be the time to do so

library(dplyr)
library(Synth)

# We're going to use simulated data included in the Synth package for our example.
# This dataframe consists of panel data including 1 outcome variable and 3 predictor variables for 1 treatment unit and 7 control units (donor pool) over 21 years

data("synth.data")

# The primary function that we will use is the synth() function.
# However, this function needs four particularly formed matrices as inputs, so it is highly recommended that you use the dataprep() function to generate the inputs.
# Once we've gathered our dataprep() output, we can just use that as our sole input for synth() and we'll be good to go.
# One important note is that your data must be in long format with id variables (integers) and name variables (character) for each unit.

dataprep_out = dataprep(
  foo = synth.data, # first input is our data
  predictors = c("X1", "X2", "X3"), # identify our predictor variables
  predictors.op = "mean", # operation to be performed on the predictor variables for when we form our X_1 and X_0 matrices.
  time.predictors.prior = c(1984:1989), # pre-intervention window
  dependent = "Y", # outcome variable
  unit.variable = "unit.num", # identify our id variable
  unit.names.variable = "name", # identify our name variable
  time.variable = "year", # identify our time period variable
  treatment.identifier = 7, # integer that indicates the id variable value for our treatment unit
  controls.identifier = c(2, 13, 17, 29, 
                          32, 36, 38), # vector that indicates the id variable values for the donor pool
  time.optimize.ssr = c(1984:1990), # identify the time period you want to optimize over to find the W*. Includes pre-treatment period and the treatment year.
  time.plot = c(1984:1996) # periods over which results are to be plotted with Synth's plot functions
)

# Now we have our data ready in the form of a list. We have all the matrices we need to run synth()
# Our output from the synth() function will be a list that includes our optimal weight matrix W*

synth_out = dataprep_out %>% synth()

# From here, we can plot the treatment variable and the synthetic control using Synth's plot function.
# The variable tr.intake is an optional variable if you want a dashed vertical line where the intervention takes place.

synth_out %>% path.plot(dataprep.res = dataprep_out, tr.intake = 1990)

# Finally, we can construct our synthetic control variable if we wanted to conduct difference-in-difference analysis on it to estimate the treatment effect.

synth_control = dataprep_out$Y0plot %*% synth_out$solution.w
